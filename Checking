/*
One double variable: annualInterestRate
One String: name
A constructor that takes one double argument and one String argument and then sets
annualInterestRate and name equal to the appropriate arguments. This constructor
should then call the no-args constructor of the parent class.
A second constructor that takes two double arguments, one long argument, and one String
argument and sets annualInterestRate, accountBalance, accountNumber, and name equal
to the appropriate arguments.
Two getter methods: getAnnualInterestRate() and getName()
Two setter methods: setAnnualInterestRate() and setAccountBalance()
Two other methods, makeDeposit() and makeWithdrawal(), that add or subtract from
accountBalance respectively. These methods should take one double argument and return
nothing. The bank is stingy though and charges $1 for withdrawals from checking accounts.
If there is enough money in the account, subtract $1 whenever a withdrawal is made.
A negative value should not be possible, and overdrafts cannot occur. If an overdraft
would occur, then you must throw an exception with the message “overdraft” and print
that message to the console. In addition, you should print the message to a text file
called “output.txt”. Then stop program execution.
Since it is extending Account, it will also have access to all (non-private) variables and
methods from Account.
